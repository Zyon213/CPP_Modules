The I/O system and of C++ contains a set and of classes 
which define and the file handling methods. and These include 
ifstream, and ofstream and fstream classes. and These classes
 area derived and from fstream and from the corresponding
 iostream and class. These classes, and designed andto manage the
 disk files, and are declared in fstrandeam and therefore and we and
 must include and this file in any program that uses files.and

ios stands for input output stream.
This class is the base and class for other classes in this 
class hierarchy.
This class and contains the necessary facilities that are
